    <h2>Places i visited and recommend</h2>

    id="gallery">
    <div class="img img-1">
      <p><A class="places">Notre-Dame Cathedral</A>
        <br>
        Like the Eiffel Tower, the Notre-Dame Cathedral is seen as a Parisian icon. Located right along the picturesque River Seine, the Notre-Dame Cathedral is considered a Gothic masterpiece and is often regarded as one of the best Gothic cathedrals of its kind in the world.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-2">      <p><A class="places">Musée du Louvre</A>
      <br>
      If you only had time to visit one museum in Paris, it should undoubtedly be the Musée du Louvre. That's because the Louvre is not only widely considered to be one of the best art museums in Europe, but one of the best in the world as well. The museum first opened its doors in 1793 and features a grand total of 35,000 works of art. Here you can get up close to a variety of art from different time periods and cultures.

    </p>
  </div>
    <div class="img img-3">
      <p><A class="places">Eiffel Tower</A>
      <br>
      Designed and constructed for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (the World's Fair), the Eiffel Tower was always meant to be a temporary structure, but it skirted demolition talks twice. The first time, at the beginning of the 1900s, the tower was kept around because of its transmission talents.
    </p>
  </div>
    <div class="img img-4">
      <p> <A class="places">Jardin des Tuileries</A>
        <br>
        Centrally located between the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde, the Jardin des Tuileries is a free public garden that spans approximately 55 acres. Though it was initially designed solely for the use of the royal family and court, the park was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1991 (as part of the Banks of the Seine) and has been open to the public since the 17th century. The green space holds an important role in France's history.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-5">
      <p><A class="places">Arc de Triomphe</A>
        <br>
        Situated at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, the towering Arc de Triomphe was commissioned by Napoléon to honor the Grande Armee during the Napoleonic Wars.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-6">
      <p><A class="places">Le Marais</A>
        <br>
        Straddling the 3ème and 4ème arrondissements (districts), Le Marais is one of Paris' oldest and coolest districts – so cool, in fact, that French writer Victor Hugo (author of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "Les Misérables") called it home. With all of its cobblestone streets, stately stone architecture and tucked away courtyards, it's easy to feel as if you're strolling through medieval Paris.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-7">
      <p><A class="places">Sacred Heart Basilica of Montmartre</A>
        <br>
        Rising high above Paris, the Sacré-Coeur (meaning "Sacred Heart") looks more like a white castle than a basilica – but that's what it is. Towering over the eclectic neighborhood of Montmartre (once a hangout for Paris' bohemian crowd), this Roman-Byzantine masterpiece is easily recognized by its ornate ivory domes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-8">
      <p><A class="places">Musée d'Orsay</A>
        <br>
        Housed in a former railway station along the Left Bank, the Musée d'Orsay is regarded for its rich collection of impressionist works.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-9">
      <p><A class="places">Musée Rodin</A>
        <br>
        A hidden jewel in the city, the Musée Rodin is actually the former residence of famed 19th-century sculptor Auguste Rodin. But in the place of furniture and kitschy lawn ornaments are Rodin's emotive sculptures, including The Hand of God, The Kiss and The Thinker, among many more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="img img-10">      <p><A class="places">Sainte-Chapelle</A>
      <br>
      Nowhere in Paris does stained glass windows quite as well as Sainte-Chapelle. The panes – dating back to the chapel's construction in the 13th century – depict 1,113 scenes from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible in vivid color. Sainte-Chapelle, which took just seven years to build, is a treasured example of French Gothic architecture and originally held Christian artifacts acquired by Louis IX.
    </p></div>
    <div class="img img-11">      <p><A class="places">Pantheon</A>
      <br>
      Situated in the Latin Quarter – or 5th arrondissement – of Paris, the Panthéon is a large church and burial ground with a storied history. The structure was completed in 1789 at the start of the French Revolution, and it served as a mausoleum, a church and an art gallery throughout its early years. In 1851, scientist Leon Foucault installed the Foucault pendulum within the building to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth.

    </p></div>
    <div class="img img-12">      <p><A class="places">Conciergerie</A>
      <br>
      Located next to Sainte-Chapelle, the Conciergerie was once a royal residence for various French leaders. At the end of the 14th century, King Charles V and the rest of the palace's inhabitants moved to new residences at the Louvre.
